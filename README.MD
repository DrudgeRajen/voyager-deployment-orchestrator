### Introduction
<a href = "https://github.com/the-control-group/voyager">Voyager </a> is an awesome admin tool for laravel.
It's easy to create admin tool for CMS using it awesome features ```BREAD```.

Voyager has limitation for the deployment (after you finish the work, create bread and need to publish in production. :) )

Voyager Deployment Orchestra is the package which will listen ```BREAD  Events``` (Add, Update Delete) and will generate
files, so that BREAD data can be easily seeded.

Still this package is in heavy ***WIP !!!***

### Installation

```composer require drudge-rajen/voyager-deployment-orchestrator```

### Future Tasks
- [x] Generating Files On BREAD Events.

- [ ] Writing Tests
